==========
Unit Tests:
==========
All spark:
Verify we get 2 values back from all spark
verify allspark token is cached and same token is used on same call in every subsequent call to API, can be verifed in the functional test suite too.

Post (Create) :
verify there are 10 values in the request call to transformers
verify there are 12 values in the response
verify the type of value for each (integer vs decimal, text, null values..etc) and error handling around that

GET:
verify we get a structured list name "transformers"
Verify each object in list, has the right number of values, and right type for each value

PUT(Update):
verify there are 11 values in the request call to transformers
verify there are 12 values in the response
verify the type of value for each (integer vs decimal, text, null values..etc) and error handling around that

Delete:
verify there is 1 values in the request call to transformers ({transformerID})
verify the type of value (text, null values) and error handling around that
*no mention of requirment for response, but verify we get a confirm on deletion, that's always nice to have.*

UI Page:
Verify there is a UI to input data and recieve response
Verify a button exist on screen to start battle

==========
Functional:
==========
1)Verify inputting through UI (whichever way we design it) 
a)create Soundwave, D, 8,9,2,6,7,5,6,10
  creates a transformer

b)Update ID,Soundwave, D, 8,9,2,6,7,5,6,10
  updates a transformer (and not create a new one)

c)Get transformers, list all existing ones within system

d) Button to launch battle takes list of potential fighters

2) Verify UI displays results in this format
1 battle
Winning team (Decepticons): Soundwave
Survivors from the losing team (Autobots): Hubcap

or

1 battle
Winning team (Autobots): Optimus Prime
Survivors from the winning team (Autobots): Hubcap

3) Verify The teams should be sorted by rank and faced off one on one against each other in order to determine a victor, the loser is eliminated

4) Battle functionality :
*let's get the easy ones out of the way*
* Optimus Prime and PredaKing outlier scenarios:
a) Optimus Prime against oponent X (not PK) , OP wins
b) PredaKing agsinst oponsne X (not OP) , PK wins
c) OP vs PK , both lose, game finish immediatly. all lose, no winners
d) OP vs OP , both lose, game finish immediatly. all lose, no winners
e) PK vs PK , both lose, game finish immediatly. all lose, no winners

------------------------------
*Run away, lose battle, no destruction scenarios:
Transformer A vs Transformer B

Main base scenario from requirement
		T_A	T_B
Courage		4	8	T_A is 4 points less than T_B
Strength	3	6	AND 3 points less than T_B
Result 		Run 	Win

		T_A	T_B
Courage		3	8	T_A is 5 points less than T_B
Strength	3	6	AND 3 points less than T_B
Result 		Run 	Win

		T_A	T_B
Courage		5	8	T_A is 3 points less than T_B
Strength	3	6	AND 3 points less than T_B
Result 		Continue

		T_A	T_B
Courage		4	8	T_A is 4 points less than T_B
Strength	2	6	AND 4 points less than T_B
Result 		Run 	Win

		T_A	T_B
Courage		4	8	T_A is 4 points less than T_B
Strength	4	6	AND 2 points less than T_B
Result 		Continue

		T_A	T_B
Courage		2	8	T_A is 6 points less than T_B
Strength	2	6	AND 4 points less than T_B
Result 		Run 	Win

		T_A	T_B
Courage		6	8	T_A is 2 points less than T_B
Strength	6	6	AND 0 points less than T_B
Result 		Continue

not sure if we want to test the opposite also,but it's the same tests flipped. do it if we have time
e.g.
		T_A	T_B
Courage		8	4	T_B is 4 points less than T_A
Strength	6	3	AND 3 points less than T_A
Result 		Win 	Run
------------------------------
* Skill win overpower scenarios:
Transformer A vs Transformer B

Main base scenario from requirement
		T_A	T_B
Skill		3	6	T_B is 3 points more than T_A
Result 		Die	Win

		T_A	T_B
Skill		2	6	T_B is 4 points more than T_A
Result 		Die	Win

		T_A	T_B
Skill		6	6	T_B is 0 points more/less than T_A
Result 		Continue

		T_A	T_B
Skill		8	6	T_B is 2 points less than T_A
Result 		Continue
------------------------------
*Main Fight Scenarios:
Overall rating wins
		T_A	T_B
Overall 	53	60	T_B is 7 points more than T_A
Result 		Die	Win

		T_A	T_B
Overall 	63	60	T_A is 3 points more than T_B
Result 		Win	Die

		T_A	T_B
Overall 	60	60	T_A tied with T_A
Result 		Die	Die
------------------------------
Battle management scenarios:
1) Verify Team number imbalance scenarios:
Team A has 3
Team B has 5
3 battles
last bottom 2 ranked in Team B survive

b) 
Team A has 1
Team B has 1
1 battle
no survivors

c)
Team A has 3
Team B has 2
2 battles
last bottom 1 ranked from team A survive

2) Verify overal Team winner scenarios (can resue team imbalance cases)
Team A has 3
Team B has 5
3 battles
	TeamA	TeamB
Battle	3Win	0Win
Result  TeamA

	TeamA	TeamB
Battle	1Win	2Win
Result  TeamB

(we can add more iterations, but it's just flipping their sides)

b) 
Team A has 1
Team B has 1
1 battle
no survivors

	TeamA	TeamB
Battle	1Win	0Win
Result  TeamA

c)
Team A has 3
Team B has 2
2 battles

	TeamA	TeamB
Battle	2Win	0Win
Result  TeamA


	TeamA	TeamB
Battle	1Win	1Win
Result  No Winners/All destruction/ tie ?
